# ItsyBitsy_M4_Oled_Eyes
Driving Oled Animations in CircuitPython

To set the project up, the following hardware is needed:
1. 1x https://www.adafruit.com/product/3800 
2. 2 x https://www.adafruit.com/product/938

For the sound effects a piezo buzzer is nedded (optional)...
1. 1x https://www.adafruit.com/product/1740

Follow the wiring diagram, and make sure to flash the two display firmware to the board!

Just double click the reset button and drag and drop the ItsyBitsyM4_2Display.uf2 inside the folder that will pop up...

For more info or in case something goes wrong, here is some more detailed information on how to do this...

Also you will need to drag and drop:
1. main.py 
2. spritesheet.bmp
3. spritesheet_look_left.bmp
4. spritesheet_look_right.bmp
5. spritesheet_look_left_low.bmp
6. spritesheet_look_right_low.bmp
7. spritesheet_happy.bmp
8. spritesheet_sad.bmp
9. spritesheet_center.bmp

Once you did this a sequence of all animations should be played back...

You can play individual animations by just sending the animations number to the serial port!

e.g "4" will play spritesheet_look_left_low.bmp

In this section of the code, you modifiy which images are being loaded and their corresponding playback commands:

```
def print_serial(data):
    print(data)
    if data ==1:
        anim_eyes(("/spritesheet_look_right_low.bmp"),.05,1,blink_sound)
    elif data ==2:
        anim_eyes(("/spritesheet_sad.bmp"),.005,0,sad_sound)
    elif data ==3:
        anim_eyes(("/spritesheet_happy.bmp"),.005,1,happy_sound)
    elif data ==4:
        anim_eyes(("/spritesheet_look_left_low.bmp"),.05,1,blink_sound)
    elif data ==5:
        anim_eyes(("/spritesheet_center.bmp"),.005,0,center_sound)
    elif data ==6:
         anim_eyes(("/spritesheet.bmp"),.005,0,blink_sound)
```

The cone is a bit messy, but it should work fine...

You can connect via Serial USB or UART...

Have fun!! :)
